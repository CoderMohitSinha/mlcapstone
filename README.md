## Capstone Project

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The code is provided in different files: 

- `airquality.ipynb` is the notebook file


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the project directory that contains this README and run the following command:

```jupyter notebook airquality.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
